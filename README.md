Data Cleaning using Nashville Housing dataset
I am going to clean up the Nashville Housing dataset for this project. We'll be doing the following things:

- Standardize date format.
- Fill in property addresses that are missing
- Separating a long address into its separate columns (Address, City, State)
- Standardize the "Sold as Vacant" field by changing it from "Y/N" to "Yes" and "No."
- Getting rid of duplicates
